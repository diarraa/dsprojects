      <description>I’m terrified as I write these words. Not because I’ve been summoned by Queen Cersei or because I’m fighting the White Walkers alongside Jon Snow. No. I wish I was though. Ok, almost. I’m terrified because this is my first step in blogging. Few years back, when I was younger, I probably would’ve been fine. But now, now that I know how much words matter, I tend to be cautious when talking or writing.</description>
